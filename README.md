Principles of Programming Languages

This repository contains all projects and assignments from my "Principles of Programming Languages" course. The course focused on understanding how programming language features are implemented, particularly through building interpreters.

Course Highlights:

We explored the core concepts behind various programming language features, including:

    Variable Scope

    Parameter Passing (by value vs. by reference)

    Recursion (including tail recursion)

A major component of the course involved implementing a series of interpreters. This hands-on approach gave me insight into how compilers and interpreters work to support these features.

Key Learning Areas:

    Functional Programming: A paradigm essential for compact interpreter design.

    Scheme: Our initial language for understanding functional programming basics and building interpreters. We also covered Abstract Data Types (ADT).

    ML: A more advanced functional language used to explore concepts like Infinite Lists and Lazy Evaluation.
